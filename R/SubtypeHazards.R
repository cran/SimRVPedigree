#' Age-specific hazard rate dataset with subtypes
#'
#' A dataset that contains the following age-specific hazard rates: (1) the age-specific hazard rates for Hodgkin Lymphoma and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in the United States, (2) the age-specific hazard rates for death in the United States, and (3) the age-specific hazard rates for death for individuals, living in the United States, who have been diagnosed with either Hodgkin Lymphoma and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.
#'
#'  The \code{SubtypeHazards} dataset contains the following age-specific hazard rates which \strong{roughly mimic}: (1) the age-specific hazard rates for Hodgkin Lymphoma and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in the United States, (2) the age-specific hazard rates for death in the United States, and (3) the age-specific hazard rates for death for individuals, living in the United States, who have been diagnosed with either Hodgkin Lymphoma and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.  The age-specific hazard rates of disease onset and death in the affected populations were estimated by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) SEER*Stat Software, and the age-specific hazard rates of death in the United States were estimated from actuarial life tables provided by the Social Security Administration.
#'
#'  The four columns in the \code{SubtypeHazards} dataset provide age-specific hazard rates, in yearly increments, beginning at age 0 and ending with age 100.  That is, the values in the first row describe the hazard rates for an individual whose age is contained in the interval [0, 1), while the values in the second row describe the hazard rates for an individual whose age is contained in the interval [1, 2), and so on.
