\title{Create an object of class hazard.}
\usage{
hazard(hazardDF, partition = NULL, subtype_ID = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{hazardDF}{Data.frame. A data.frame contianing the age-specific hazard rate(s) of \emph{disease} in the population of interest, the age-specific hazard rate for \emph{death} in the \strong{unaffected} population, and the age-specific hazard rate for \emph{death} in the \strong{affected} population.  See details.}

\item{partition}{Numeric vector. The partition of ages, in years, over which to apply the age-specific hazard rates in \code{hazardDF}. If not supplied,  defaults to a partition that starts at 0 and increases in yearly increments.  See details.}

\item{subtype_ID}{List. If specifying a disease with multiple subtypes, a list of character subtype IDs.  By default, \code{subtype_ID = NULL}, i.e. no subtypes to simulate.}
}
\value{
An object of class hazard.
}
\description{
Create a hazard object, required input for \code{\link{sim_RVped}}, \code{\link{sim_ped}}, and \code{\link{sim_life}} functions.
}
\details{
Users are permitted to specify harzard objects for two scenarios: (1) for a disease without subtypes or  (2) for a disease with multiple subtypes.

When simulating a disease \emph{without subtypes}, \code{hazardDF} must contain 3 columns that meet the following criteria:
\describe{
 \item{column 1:}{age-specific hazard rates of \emph{disease} for the population of interest}
 \item{column 2:}{age-specific hazard rates of \emph{death} for the \strong{unaffected} population.  If the disease of interest is sufficiently rare, so that death by the disease is rare, the user may choose to use the population, age-specific, hazard rates of death instead.}
 \item{column 3:}{age-specific hazard rates of \emph{death} for the \strong{affected} population.}
}

When simulating a disease \emph{with n disease subtypes}, \code{hazardDF} must contain n + 2 columns that meet the following criteria:
\describe{
 \item{column 1:}{age-specific hazard rates of \emph{disease} for the first subtype of interest}
 \item{column 2:}{age-specific hazard rates of \emph{disease} for the second subtype of interest}
 \item{...}{}
 \item{column n:}{age-specific hazard rates of \emph{disease} for the \eqn{n^{th}} subtype of interest}
 \item{column n + 1:}{age-specific hazard rates of \emph{death} for the \strong{unaffected} population.  If the disease of interest is sufficiently rare, so that death by the disease is rare, the user may choose to use the population, age-specific, hazard rates of death instead.}
 \item{column n + 2:}{age-specific hazard rates of \emph{death} for an individual affectd by any of the \eqn{n} subtypes.}
}
Users must provide \code{partition} in years; e.g. a hazard rate for a baby between 6 months and 1 year of age should have lower bound 0.5 years and an upper bound 1 year.  Additionally, \code{partition} must apply to all of the age-specific hazard rates in \code{hazardDF}.
