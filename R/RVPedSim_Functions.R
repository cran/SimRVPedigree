#' Trim pedigree based on proband recall
#'
#' Primarily intended as an internal function, \code{trim_ped} chooses a proband and trims relatives based on the proband's probability of recalling his or her relatives.
#'
#' By default \code{recall_probs} is four times the kinship coefficient, as defined by Thompson (see references), between the proband and the probands relative, which results in a recall probability of \eqn{2^{-(n-1)}} for a relative of degree \eqn{n}. Alternatively, the user may specify a list of recall probabilities of length \eqn{l > 0}, in which case the first \emph{l-1} items in \code{recall_probs} are the respective proband recall probabilities for relatives of degree \emph{1, 2, ..., l-1}, and the \emph{l}th item in \code{recall_probs} is the proband's recall probability for all relatives of degree \strong{\emph{l} or greater}.  For example if \code{recall_probs = c(1)} all relatives will be recalled by the proband with probability 1.
#'
#'
#' Occasionally, a trimmed family member must be retained to ensure that the pedigree can be plotted.  When this occurs, family members who share a non-zero kinship coefficient with the proband are censored of all pertinent information, and will always have the following qualities:
#' \enumerate{
#'   \item availability status = 0
#'   \item affected status = NA
#'   \item birth year = NA
#'   \item onset year = NA
#'   \item death year = NA
#'   \item RR = NA
#' }

#' Simulate a pedigree ascertained to contain multiple disease-affected relatives
#'
#' \code{sim_RVped} simulates a pedigree ascertained to contain multiple affected members, selects a proband, and trims the pedigree to contain only those individuals that are recalled by the proband.
#'
#' When \code{RV_founder = TRUE}, all simulated pedigrees will segregate a genetic susceptibility variant.  In this scenario, we assume that the variant is rare enough that it has been introduced by one founder, and we begin the simulation of the pedigree with this founder.  Alternatively, when \code{RV_founder = FALSE} we simulate the starting founder's causal variant status with probability \code{carrier_prob}.  When \code{RV_founder = FALSE} pedigrees may not segregate the genetic susceptibility variant.  The default selection is \code{RV_founder = FALSE}.  Additionally, we note that \code{sim_RVpedigree} is intended for rare causal variants; users will recieve a warning if \code{carrier_prob > 0.002}.
#'
#' We note that when \code{GRR = 1}, pedigrees do not segregate the causal variant regardless of the setting selected for \code{RVfounder}.  When the causal variant is introduced to the pedigree we transmit it from parent to offspring according to Mendel's laws.
#'
#' We begin simulating the pedigree by generating the year of birth, uniformly, between the years specified in \code{founder_byears} for the starting founder.  Next, we simulate this founder's life events using the \code{\link{sim_life}} function, and censor any events that occur after the study \code{stop_year}.  Possible life events include: reproduction, disease onset, and death. We continue simulating life events for any offspring, censoring events which occur after the study stop year, until the simulation process terminates.  We do not simulate life events for marry-ins, i.e. individuals who mate with either the starting founder or offspring of the starting founder.
#'
#' We do not model disease remission. Rather, we impose the restriction that individuals may only experience disease onset once, and remain affected from that point on.  If disease onset occurs then we apply the hazard rate for death in the affected population.
#'
#' \code{sim_RVped} will only return ascertained pedigrees with at least \code{num_affected} affected individuals.  That is, if a simulated pedigree does not contain at least \code{num_affected} affected individuals \code{sim_RVped} will discard the pedigree and simulate another until the condition is met.  We note that even for \code{num_affected = 2}, \code{sim_RVped} can be computationally expensive.  To simulate a pedigree with no proband, and without a minimum number of affected members use instead \code{\link{sim_ped}}.
#'
#' Upon simulating a pedigree with \code{num_affected} individuals, \code{sim_RVped} chooses a proband from the set of available candidates.  Candidates for proband selection must have the following qualities:
#' \enumerate{
#'   \item experienced disease onset between the years specified by \code{ascertain_span},
#'   \item if less than \code{num_affected} - 1 individuals experienced disease onset prior to the lower bound of \code{ascertain_span}, a proband is chosen from the affected individuals, such that there were at least \code{num_affected} affected individuals when the pedigree was ascertained through the proband.
#' }
#'
#' We allow users to specify the first year that reliable diagnoses can be made using the argument \code{first_diagnosis}.  All subjects who experience disease onset prior to this year are not considered when ascertaining the pedigree for a specific number of disease-affected relatives.  By default, \code{first_diagnosis = NULL} so that all affected relatives, recalled by the proband, are considered when ascertaining the pedigree.
#'
#' After the proband is selected, the pedigree is trimmed based on the proband's recall probability of his or her relatives.  This option is included to allow researchers to model the possibility that a proband either cannot provide a complete family history or that they explicitly request that certain family members not be contacted.  If \code{recall_probs} is missing, the default values of four times the kinship coefficient, as defined by Thompson (see references), between the proband and his or her relatives are assumed.  This has the effect of retaining all first degree relatives with probability 1, retaining all second degree relatives with probability 0.5, retaining all third degree relatives with probability 0.25, etc.  Alternatively, the user may specify a list of length \eqn{l}, such that the first \eqn{l-1} items represent the respective recall probabilities for relatives of degree \eqn{1, 2, ... , l-1} and the \eqn{l^{th}} item represents the recall probability of a relative of degree \eqn{l} or greater. For example, if \code{recall_probs = c(1, 0.75, 0.5)}, then all first degree relatives (i.e. parents, siblings, and offspring) are retained with probability 1, all second degree relatives (i.e. grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews) are retained with probability 0.75, and all other relatives are retained with probability 0.5. To simulate fully ascertained pedigrees, simply specify \code{recall_probs = c(1)}.
#'
#'
#' In the event that a trimmed pedigree fails the \code{num_affected} condition,  \code{sim_RVped} will discard that pedigree and simulate another until the condition is met.  For this reason, the values specified for \code{recall_probs} affect computation time.
