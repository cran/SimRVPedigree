\title{obtain the waiting time to the next event}
\usage{
get_wait_time(p, last_event, hazard, part, scale = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{Numeric.  A probability; i.e. the argument of the quantile function of the waiting time associated with a non-homogeneous Poisson process with rate \code{hazard}.}

\item{last_event}{A positive number.  The time at last event.}

\item{hazard}{A vector of positive numbers.  The time-specific hazard rate.}

\item{part}{A vector of positive numbers.  Time partition over which to apply the time-specific hazard rate.}

\item{scale}{Logical. By default \code{scale = FALSE}.  Specifying \code{scale = TRUE} ensures that this function is the quantile function for a proper random variable.}
}
\value{
The waiting time to next event, units same as those in \code{part}.
}
\description{
\code{get_wait_time} approximates the result of the inverse cumulative distribution function of the waiting time to the next event associated with a non-homogeneous Poisson process conditioned of the time of the last event.
}
\details{
\code{get_wait_time} obtains the waiting time to next event associated with a non-homogeneous Poisson process.  The units of the simulated waiting time are the units specified in \code{part}, i.e. if \code{part} is specified in years, the simulated waiting time is in years.
