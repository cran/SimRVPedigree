\title{Censor pedigree data}
\usage{
censor_ped(ped_file, censor_year = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ped_file}{An object of class \code{ped}. A pedigree generated by \code{sim_ped} or \code{sim_RVped}, or an object created by the function \code{\link{new.ped}}.  See details.}

\item{censor_year}{Numeric. The censor year. If not supplied, defaults to the year the pedigree was ascertained, i.e. the proband's onset year.  See details.}
}
\value{
The censored pedigree.
}
\description{
\code{censor_ped} censors a pedigree of any information that occurs after a specified year.
}
\details{
Upon supplying a pedigree and a censor year the \code{censor_ped} function will remove all individuals born after \code{censor_year} and censor all disease onset and death events after the \code{censor_year}.

Users who wish to use \code{censor_ped} for pedigrees not generated by \code{\link{sim_ped}} or \code{\link{sim_RVped}} must use \code{\link{new.ped}} to create an object of class \code{ped}.  When creating the \code{ped} object please provide as much relevant date information as possible, i.e. years of birth, onset, and death.  When present please specify a proband as described in \code{\link{new.ped}}.

By default, \code{censor_year} is set to the year that the pedigree is ascertained, i.e. the year the proband experienced disease onset. However, if \code{ped_file} does not contain the proband identification variable the user must supply a value for \code{censor_year}.
